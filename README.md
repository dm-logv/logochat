Just a simple example of client-server application.


## Usage

- Use `run_server.py` to run a Server
- Use `run_gui.py` to run a Client part (repeat this step many times :)
    - Input `/connect` command to connect (surprise!) Client to Server
    - Input `/name John` to change your name to **John**
    - Input `/quit` to disconnect Client from Server
- Try to enjoy!
